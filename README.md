### Hypothesis

Is there a relationship between where you live and rate of new cancer cases?

#### To do:

* Finish poverty rate vs. cancer rate in each county in California notebook
* Based on test results, write our alternate and null hypothesis
* Create presentation PPT
* Decide who will be responsible for presenting which parts
* Write script

#### The areas we will look at are:

1. Time zone (lng) vs. cancer rate
	- Pacific Time (PT), Mountain (MT), Central (CT), Eastern (ET)

2. Location (lat) vs. cancer rate
	- Lower 48 states

3. Poverty rate vs. cancer rate in each county in California

#### The sources we will use are:

* Lat and Lng from Open Weather Map API
* 2018 Poverty and Income from US Census data API
* Cancer rate from CDC CSV
