### Hypothesis

Is there a relationship between where you live and rate of new cancer cases?

#### To do:

* DK will present intro and conclusion, NT will present longtitude, RR will present latitude, LL will present poverty
* You have 2.5 minutes each to talk
	* Describe the exploration and cleanup process
	* Discuss insights you had while exploring the data that you didn't anticipate
	* Discuss any problems that arose after exploring the data, and how you resolved them
	* Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal

#### The areas we will look at are:

1. Time zone (lng) vs. cancer rate
	- Pacific Time (PT), Mountain (MT), Central (CT), Eastern (ET)

2. Location (lat) vs. cancer rate
	- Lower 48 states

3. Poverty rate vs. cancer rate in each State

#### The sources we will use are:

* Lat and Lng from Open Weather Map API
* 2018 Poverty and Income from US Census data API
* Cancer rate from CDC CSV
